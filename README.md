conclusion:
1- if we take mean of NaN values,it increases the more than the other values
2- if we drop the values it will effect the data beacuse their are many rows which have NaN values but other data is complete.
3- Linear and decision tree gave the best and the nearest answers almost in ever year.
4- but if we apply train test methode then the best answer comes from Polynomial Linear Regression.
5- if we apply Support Vector Regression it will also not predict the next year answers
so
**The best option for this data is Polynomial Linear Regression**
